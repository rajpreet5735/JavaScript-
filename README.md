# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! This repository will contain various coding projects and assignments from my course. Each project will demonstrate the skills and concepts I am learning in JavaScript, from basic syntax to more advanced programming techniques. 

I will be regularly updating this repository as I complete assignments and challenges, and I look forward to receiving feedback from my instructor.
